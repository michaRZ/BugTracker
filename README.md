# Bug Tracker
### Final Project for Blue Badge

The bug tracker is an API Tool designed to help you track bugs alongside projects and your developers that work on them.The Bug Tracker can be used to track Projects, People, and Bugs. 

Projects contain a start Date, Projected End Date to help you track bugs over it's Life cycle. Projects can be made inactive to indicate that a project is no longer being worked on. 

People(Person) can be added to the database so you are able to track what bugs they are assigned to fixing, as well as the role they occupy in your company.

Bugs can be created and tied to a project as well as the people that work on them. They come with a status that allows them to be tracked along the Defect life cycle. When a bug is fixed, you can input a resolution summary to explain the issue in depth if this was not already covered as well as the steps you took to fix it. The bug will then be set to inactive to remove it from most GET functions.
